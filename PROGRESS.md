## In Progress

### Code Quality
- [ ] Clean up existing code style issues
- [ ] Add more comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Increase test coverage

## Planned

### CI/CD
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Set up code quality checks in CI
- [ ] Implement automated deployment to staging/production

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Write developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Document deployment process

### Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add more comprehensive authentication
- [ ] Set up security scanning in CI

### Performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Containerization with Docker
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment

- [ ] GraphQL API

## üêõ Known Issues

- None currently documented

## üìö Resources

- [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [SQLAlchemy Async Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html)
- [Alembic Documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
- [pgvector Documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Testing

The project uses unittest for testing API endpoints:

```bash
# Run a specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest -v tests.test_fastapi

# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### API Testing with HTTPie

The project includes a script for testing API endpoints with HTTPie:

```bash
# Run the test script
./tests/test_api.py

# Or manually test endpoints
http POST http://localhost:8000/conversations/ title="Test Conversation"
http GET http://localhost:8000/conversations/
```

### Database Testing

## Recent Updates

### 2023-02-27: Code Quality Setup
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Set up flake8, black, and isort
- Created code cleanup script
- Updated testing framework to work with pytest
- Fixed issues with pytest-asyncio

### Next Steps
1. Run code cleanup script to fix style issues
2. Commit changes and push to repository
3. Start using pre-commit hooks for future development
4. Begin planning CI/CD pipeline setup
